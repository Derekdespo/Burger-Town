# Burger-Town

## Description
Burger Town is a node application that allows a user to input a burger order, eat the burgers, and choose between deleting and re-ordering a finished burger again.

## Installation
For this application you will need to make sure you have a few npms installed first. You will need: mysql, express, and express-handlebars. Mysql will allow us to get a database set up. Express helps us to set up routes. Express-handlebars will give us an easy way to add html elements to the page

## Usage
This application is fairly simple to use. To order you burger, just enter the name, select "Let's Eat, and click "add order". Your order will appear under "Order Up". Once it is there, you can choose to delete it completely or "Eat Up." If you select "Eat Up", the burger will move over to "All Gone." Here you can choose to delete it or "Order Again," sending it back to "Order Up".
